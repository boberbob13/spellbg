# Spellcheck (the original project) and its Bulgarian translation

<https://youtu.be/KK3mS4bQ5JM>
Spellcheck is an webapp made by Answer in Progress to practice spelling just for fun or for Spelling Bee competition.
So i translated it in Bulgarian, well not really - just some pages, the words aren't touched (yet).

The project is still not fully ready, soo don't download it :)

_Spellcheck е уеб-приложение създадено от Answer in Progress (канал в ютуб) за да се подготвяш за Spelling Bee състезания или за да тестваш знанията си на английски.
Затова го преведох на Български, е, не точно - само някои от страниците за да бъде по-достъпно. Думите, дефинициите и преводи не са пипани (все още)._

_Проектът все още не е готов изцяло, за това по-добре не го изтегляйте :)_

## Known Issues

* Emoji results are awful for the colourblind
* Pronunciation goes very rogue at points
  * Examples: very, ascension, porcelain, rosin, reveille, hat, upon, portcullus, innovator, pie, vineyard, concatenate, javas, thrasonical, annual, fribourg, rubric, retrodict, expatiated, hem, hermeneutics, wizard, arsenic, power, expression, longitude, accordance, gonzo, toga, epoch
* Submit button on mobile is too close to keys - it might be worth just switching to a mobile keyboard
* On-screen keyboard is very laggy
* Spelling system is inconsistent between British and American spelling
  * Examples: medival, squints
* "A adjective" - my bad, I forgot adjectives existed
* Some ChatGPT etymology calls returned something akin to "My apologies, I do not understand your request"
  * Examples: aerials, autographs, scrambling
* Accidental refresh removes progress - may be better to store results into local storage (but also I have no idea if this will store results into a new day)
* Submitting on first word in practice mode will allow you to go into negative lives lmao
* Copy results sometimes fails (someone has recommended a fix)

## Possible Extensions

* Mass select + deleter character inputs
* Inserting characters without erasing
* Multiple accept options
* A version with game rooms and folks could follow the more traditional round and elimination format in spelling bees.
* Adding more words
* Word playback on results page
* Ability to store list of words for future practice
